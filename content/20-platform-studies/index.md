# Platform Studies

## (Historical) Data on Platforms

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are great for accessing and gathering current platform data. A number of projects are dedicated to archiving and publishing historical platform data. 


### Reddit

- Pushshift is archiving comment data from the social news aggregator Reddit since 2005. 
	- The data can be downloaded at: [Reddit Archive @ Pushhift](http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/)
	- The archive can be queried with [Google Big Query](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/fh-bigquery:reddit_comments?pli=1).
- Nathan Yau created an impressive visualization based on the data analyzing the [*Growth of Subreddits* \| FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/2018/10/30/subreddit-comments/)


### Wikipedia

- Being not a platform in the srtict sense of the concept Wikipedia nevertheless constitutes a vivid project and community with a build in "history" because MediaWiki – the software Wikipedia runs on – tracks all changes to any page on Wikipedia. The Wikimedia foundation provides various data dumps (mostly on a monthly basis) to all language editions of Wikipedia. The [Wikimedia Downloads](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/) page provides links to the most recent data dumps of active Wikis as well as to data dumps to discontintued Wikis.


### Github
