Software occupies an important place in digital cultures. A number of critical studies have been proposed for exploring digital media cultures, such as interface studies, code studies, algorithm studies, data studies, and also software studies. These fields of inquiry are not clearly separated, but overlap in a variety of ways. Software Studies is dedicated to the study of software as a medium and asks about the influence of software in contemporary cultures. Software connects interfaces, codes, algorithms, and data. The ephemeral and often proprietary nature of software poses challenges to researchers, as does the complexity of software systems. At the same time, there are archives, museums, research institutions, and individuals that provide valuable resources for the study of software. These are collected here.
