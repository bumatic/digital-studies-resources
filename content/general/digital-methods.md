summary: The term “digital methods” does not primarily refer to research methods that make use of digital tools - of course digital methods do that too - but rather a research program that aims “to learn from the so-called method of the medium, that is, how online devices treat web data” (Rogers 2019, 4). At the center is the dictum “follow the medium” (Rogers 2009, 10) to expose the specific methods of digital media on the one hand and to appropriate and repurpose them for new approaches in social research on the other hand. For following the medium and for studying social and cultural transformations grounded in digital media a broad range of research tools have been developed and made available throughout the past decade.
